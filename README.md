## What is ERC721R and ERC1155?

1.The NFT space needs greater accountability. The space faces too many rugpulls and for the health of the NFT ecosystem as a whole we need better mechanisms to prevent these from happening.Offering refunds provides greater protection for buyers and more legitimacy for creators.ERC721R provides trustless refunds.  

2.ERC1155:ERC1155 is a novel token standard. It combines the advantages of previous token standards to create an irreplaceable and efficient token contract.The distinctive feature of ERC1155 is that it uses a single smart contract to represent multiple tokens at once.
